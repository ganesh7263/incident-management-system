The Incident Management System is a web-based application designed to help organizations log, track, and resolve technical issues efficiently. It provides a user-friendly interface for reporting incidents, viewing their status, and managing the overall incident lifecycle. The system includes features such as a dashboard for quick overview, incident creation form, incident list view, and a real-time alert system.

Script for explaining the project to a recruiter:

"I'd like to tell you about an Incident Management System I developed using React and TypeScript. This project showcases my ability to create a full-featured, production-ready web application that solves real-world problems in IT operations.

Key features of the system include:

    Dashboard: Provides a quick overview of incident statistics, including total incidents, open incidents, and critical incidents. This helps managers and team leads get a snapshot of the current situation at a glance.

    Incident Reporting: I implemented a user-friendly form that allows team members to report new incidents easily. The form captures essential details such as the incident title, description, and priority level.

    Incident Tracking: The system includes a comprehensive incident list view, where users can see all reported incidents, their current status, and priority. I used color-coded badges to make it easy to identify high-priority or critical issues quickly.

    Real-time Alerts: I developed an alert system that notifies users of new critical incidents in real-time. This ensures that important issues don't go unnoticed and can be addressed promptly.

    Responsive Design: The application is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across desktop and mobile devices. This was achieved using Tailwind CSS for efficient and maintainable styling.

    Modern Tech Stack: I built this project using React with TypeScript, which demonstrates my proficiency in modern front-end development practices. I also used React Router for navigation and Lucide React for icons, showcasing my ability to integrate and work with external libraries.

    Code Quality: Throughout the project, I focused on writing clean, maintainable code. I implemented proper component structure, used TypeScript for type safety, and followed React best practices.

This project not only demonstrates my technical skills but also my understanding of creating practical, user-centric solutions for business needs. It shows my ability to think through the entire application structure, from UI/UX considerations to data management and real-time features."
